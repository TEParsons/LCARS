The **USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)** was a [24th century](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/24th_century) [Federation](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation) [*Ambassador*-class](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ambassador_class) [starship](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starship) operated by [Starfleet](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starfleet). It was the fourth Federation [starship](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starship) to bear [the name *Enterprise*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Enterprise_history). In [2344](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2344), [Captain](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Captain) [Rachel Garrett](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel_Garrett) served as the ship's [commanding officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Commanding_officer).

## History

### Final mission at Narendra III

In [2344](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2344), the *Enterprise* responded to a [distress call](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Distress_call) from the [Klingon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon) [outpost](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Outpost) on [Narendra III](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Narendra_III), which was under attack by the [Romulan Star Empire](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Romulan_Star_Empire). When the *Enterprise* arrived at the outpost, she was engaged by four [Romulan warbirds](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Romulan_warbird_(2340s)). The ship was hopelessly outnumbered, and suffered major damage to her [warp nacelles](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_nacelle) and external [hull](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hull), with all but 125 crew members being killed.

During the firefight, a [temporal rift](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_rift) was created. The ship entered and almost instantly emerged from it, before she was ultimately destroyed.

### Creation of an alternate history

The severely damaged *Enterprise* drifted through the rift, emerging in the year [2366](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2366) (precisely twenty-two years, three months, and four days later), and encountered her successor, the [*Galaxy*-class](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy_class) [USS *Enterprise*-D](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)). The crew discovered that the outpost at Narendra III had been completely destroyed, and a state of [war](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation-Klingon_War_(alternate_timeline)) existed between the [Klingon Empire](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon_Empire) and the Federation. Both crews eventually realized that the current timeline was a result of the *Enterprise*-C's absence from the battle, and determined that the *Enterprise*-C needed to return to its own time through the rift.

The *Enterprise* emerges in the future

While the *Enterprise*-D assisted in repairs, both ships soon came under attack from the Klingons, and Captain Garrett was subsequently killed.

[Lieutenant](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lieutenant) [Natasha Yar](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Natasha_Yar), the *Enterprise*-D's [tactical officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_officer), learned from [Guinan](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Guinan) that, if the *Enterprise*-C was successful, in the new timeline that would be created she would die a meaningless death. Not comfortable with that idea, Yar requested and was granted a transfer to the *Enterprise*-C.

The last surviving [senior officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Senior_officer) of the *Enterprise*-C, Lt. [Richard Castillo](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Castillo), assumed command of the ship and, under the protection of the *Enterprise*-D, took her back into the rift to return to 2344.
