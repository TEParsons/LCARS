The **USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-C)** was a [24th century](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/24th_century) [Federation](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation) [*Ambassador*-class](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ambassador_class) [starship](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starship) operated by [Starfleet](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starfleet). It was the fourth Federation [starship](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starship) to bear [the name *Enterprise*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Enterprise_history). In [2344](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2344), [Captain](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Captain) [Rachel Garrett](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel_Garrett) served as the ship's [commanding officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Commanding_officer).

## History

### Final mission at Narendra III

In [2344](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2344), the *Enterprise* responded to a [distress call](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Distress_call) from the [Klingon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon) [outpost](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Outpost) on [Narendra III](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Narendra_III), which was under attack by the [Romulan Star Empire](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Romulan_Star_Empire). When the *Enterprise* arrived at the outpost, she was engaged by four [Romulan warbirds](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Romulan_warbird_(2340s)). The ship was hopelessly outnumbered, and suffered major damage to her [warp nacelles](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_nacelle) and external [hull](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hull), with all but 125 crew members being killed.

During the firefight, a [temporal rift](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Temporal_rift) was created. The ship entered and almost instantly emerged from it, before she was ultimately destroyed. ([TNG](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation): "[Yesterday's Enterprise](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Yesterday's_Enterprise_(episode))")

### Creation of an alternate history

The severely damaged *Enterprise* drifted through the rift, emerging in the year [2366](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2366) (precisely twenty-two years, three months, and four days later), and encountered her successor, the [*Galaxy*-class](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy_class) [USS *Enterprise*-D](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)). The crew discovered that the outpost at Narendra III had been completely destroyed, and a state of [war](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Federation-Klingon_War_(alternate_timeline)) existed between the [Klingon Empire](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon_Empire) and the Federation. Both crews eventually realized that the current timeline was a result of the *Enterprise*-C's absence from the battle, and determined that the *Enterprise*-C needed to return to its own time through the rift.

The *Enterprise* emerges in the future

While the *Enterprise*-D assisted in repairs, both ships soon came under attack from the Klingons, and Captain Garrett was subsequently killed.

[Lieutenant](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lieutenant) [Natasha Yar](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Natasha_Yar), the *Enterprise*-D's [tactical officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Tactical_officer), learned from [Guinan](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Guinan) that, if the *Enterprise*-C was successful, in the new timeline that would be created she would die a meaningless death. Not comfortable with that idea, Yar requested and was granted a transfer to the *Enterprise*-C.

The last surviving [senior officer](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Senior_officer) of the *Enterprise*-C, Lt. [Richard Castillo](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Castillo), assumed command of the ship and, under the protection of the *Enterprise*-D, took her back into the rift to return to 2344. ([TNG](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation): "[Yesterday's Enterprise](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Yesterday's_Enterprise_(episode))")

### Back to 2344

The *Enterprise* returns to its proper time

The *Enterprise*-C returned at the same time it left its timeline. It engaged the Romulans and was eventually destroyed. In the aftermath of the battle, the Klingons were deeply impressed by the act of self-sacrifice by a Starfleet crew to protect a Klingon outpost, and the *Enterprise*'s ultimate legacy was reinforcing the relations between the [Klingon Empire](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Klingon_Empire) and the [United Federation of Planets](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets), leading to a [close alliance of peace](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance).

A number of the ship's crewmembers, including Yar, were captured by the Romulans and held prisoner. Yar later gave birth to a half-Romulan daughter named [Sela](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sela).

### Legacy

Starfleet did not commission [another *Enterprise*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)) until nearly two decades later in [2363](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2363). ([TNG](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation): "[Redemption II](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Redemption_II_(episode))")

[Sculptures](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Sculpture) of the *Enterprise*-C later adorned the walls of the [observation lounges](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Observation_lounge) on both the [USS *Enterprise*-D](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-D)) until 2368 and the [USS *Enterprise*-E](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)) launched in [2372](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/2372).
